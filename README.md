# DaML: Custom Machine Learning Library

## Overview

DaML is a personal machine learning library project developed to deepen understanding of machine learning data structures and their low-level implementations. The library is being written in C++, with plans to create a Python API for enhanced usability.

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Gain a deeper understanding of machine learning data structures.
- Implement these structures at a low level using C++.
- Create a user-friendly Python API to enhance accessibility and usability.

## Features

The current focus of the project is on developing the `Array` class. This class draws inspiration from well-established libraries such as NumPy and MLX, which themselves are influenced by PyTorch, NumPy, and Jax.
